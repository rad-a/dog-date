## User Story
```
I am a dog owner who wants to find the best dog parks 
to go to with my dog.

I want to be able to save my and my dog's info so that I'm 
welcomed each time I open the site.

Once I'm "logged in," I want to see a map of dog parks 
near me and be able to choose different options.

I also want to see my current weather 
so I know what it's like outside right now.

It's important to me that I'm able to see a picture of 
the park and its rating, along with its other info.

When I select a park, I want to make sure I know the weather for that 
area and its forecast so I can decide on a day to go.

Once I decide on a park, I want to be able to get directions to that park.

I also want to be able to "log out" in case my friend wants to log in.
```

## Development Guidelines
```
1. Use 2 server-side APIs
2. CSS framework NOT Bootstrap
3. One new 3rd party API
4. Polished, mobile-first UI
5. Good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming, etc.)
6. Does NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts (look into *modals*)
7. Deployed to GitHub pages
8. Must be interactive
```

## Application Preview

Just like people, dogs have many personalities and enjoy different types of play. Some dogs enjoy dog parks to make friends but many dogs don't. Other concerns a dog owner might have is gentler play style for older dogs. Alternatively, sometimes a dog just needs to pick on someone his own size. For this reason we are building Dog Date. A way to set up a profile for you and your furry friend to find the perfect playmate. Users can add photos and info on their animals, as well as search location services to see other users nearby. The user may also search and narrow results by breed size, age, spay/neutered, and even personality. Once the user has found a friend for their dog, the users can message each other to schedule a play date and optionally add it to an internal calendar.

I am a dog owner seeking playmates for my dog.

Interface will open up with my profile photo and a map below showing nearby users.

Given I create a user profile for my dog and I can see other dog owners nearby.

While browsing through other users I can filter results by breed and dog age.  
(temperament, male female, intact or non intact)

When I find a suitable dog companion then I can message the user and ask to schedule a play date!

When a play date is scheduled, the user can choose to add it to a calendar and set reminders.
